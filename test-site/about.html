     <h2>About DOTA 2</h2>
  <p class="first">Defence Of The Ancients  (DOTA) 2 Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed
  and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod
  for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two
  teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently 
  controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect
  experience points and items for their heroes to successfully battle the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by
  being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".
  
<h3>Development of DOTA 2</h3>
<hr>
<p class="second">
Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of the original Defense of the Ancients mod, was hired by Valve to create a
 modernized sequel. Dota 2 was officially released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers via the digital distribution
 platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only public beta phase that began two years prior. The game initially used the original Source
 game engine until it was ported to Source 2 in 2015, making it the first game to use it. As the game is fully free-to-play with no heroes needing
 to be bought or unlocked, revenue is made from microtransactions, specifically loot boxes, battle passes, and a monthly-based subscription system
 called Dota Plus, which all offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods, such as cosmetic hero armor and weapon replacements, in return.

<h3>Criticism & Complexity</h3>
<hr>
<p class="second">
 Despite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and complexity, the game was praised
 for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with multiple
 gaming publications later considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Since
 its release, Dota 2 has been one of the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent
 players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise for it being produced,
 including apparel, accessories, and toys, as well as promotional tie-ins to other games and media.
 The game also allows for the community to create custom game modes, maps, and hero cosmetics, which
 are uploaded to the Steam Workshop and curated by Valve. A digital collectible card game spin-off by Valve,
 titled Artifact, will be released in late 2018.
